Creating Dockerfile
docker build -t ajeetraina/alpine-git .
docker tag ajeetraina/alpine-git ajeetraina/labs-git:v1.0
docker images

=================
COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.

ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
======================

Volumes
=======
docker volume ls
docker volume create demo
docker inspect demo
docker volume rm demo

$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)


Letâ€™s run a container and mount the created volume to the root:
$ docker run -it -v my-volume:/data --name my-container selaworkshops/busybox:latest

Creating Volume Mount from docker run command & sharing same Volume Mounts among multiple containers
