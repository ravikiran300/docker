Dockerfile is a set of instructions and commands used to build an image

o Avoid unnecessary packages and files.
o Use multi-stage build.
o Keep number of layers to minimum.


COPY takes in a src and destination.
It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.

ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. 
Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.


Frequently used Dockerfile Instructions:
 FROM
o Sets base/parent Image.

LABEL
o Adds metadata to the image.

RUN
o Creates new layer.

 EXPOSE
o Intend port to publish.

 CMD
o Setting default command for container. It can be overridden.

 ENTRYPOINT
o Specify executable inside the container. It does not get overridden.
o However, it can be overridden by --entrypoint flag
